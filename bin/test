# Run the tests.
#
# Test files after the first have been mysteriously failing in what appears
# to be async failures. By splitting the tests up into separate files we hit one
# at a time and that stabilizes the tests somewhat.
#
# More recently, this has clarified to be at least partially:
# @code
#     Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'replace' of undefined
#     at null.<anonymous> (generators/environment/index.js:44:48)
# @endcode
#
# @todo fix the tests and run with a single command in package.json.
